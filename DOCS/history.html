      <h3>26 July 2009</h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Switched to QT. Required version
is QT 4.5 (tested with 4.5.2)</span><br>
To obtain the newest QT version go to http://www.qtsoftware.com/.
Remember that KSP requires QT 4.5.x. All other QT versions ARE NOT
supported. Note than each build contains proper libraries so you don't
have to download over 300 mb archive from http://www.qtsoftware.com/.
All you require is installed with KSP. If you are building KSP from
source then you may want to download latest SVN build as well.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">WebKit is being used for Icecast
browsing, Icecast support (no XSPF playlists support yet)</span><br>
Go to Library-&gt;Internet Media to use builtin web browser based on QT
Webkit. Whenever link you click leads to PLS or M3U playlist KSP will
handle it and load replacing currently loaded playlist.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Simple notifications on playlist
end and playfile</span><br>
When new file is played or playlist end is reached simple notification
is displayed. At the moment it is in development so all configuration
can be made only byediting setup.opt file. Find section [Alerts] in
setup.opt file and put there:<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OnNewSongPlayed=1</span><br>
to enable alerts<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OnNewSongPlayed=0</span> <br>
to disable them<br>
      <br>
      <h3>24 July 2009</h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MySQL support is only optional,
support for Sqlite3 added</span><br>
Sqlite3 is now the default database format.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manual folders scan and database
setup dialog buttons added</span><br>
Go to Library-&gt;Setup and press Force Rescan button to scan folders
again. Note that scanning proces might take a while. In
Library-&gt;Setup there is also Setup Database button. KSP now supports
both Sqlite3 and MySQL databases. By default KSP uses Sqlite3 database
that doesn't require configuration. Although if you want to use MySQL
then use that button to configure connection to database server.<br>
