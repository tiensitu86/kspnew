      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R4</h2>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Track marks</span><br>
KSP tracks all media files' in library statistics and determines marks
based on gathered data. Each track can have up to 5 stars based on how
often it is being played in comparison to other files in library<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Code cleanups</span><br>
Unused units, variables and so on are removed.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Proxy Settings</span><br>
User can define proxy settings for internal web browser. Proxy and
network settings for BASS library are not present yet<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hide to tray changes</span><br>
Hiding main window to tray was possible in previous versions however
here it is much easier. When user clicks close windows button on
application's title bar for the first time new windows appears with
question what to do next. Options are hide to tray or close KSP. User
can set one of those actions as default. Behaviour this button can be
changed in options later.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">New About KSP tab</span><br>
KSP would be nothing without Lazarus &amp; freepascal community. We
wish to say thank you and new, redesigned About KSP tab is Lazarus
dedicated. Now it says what IDE and compiler are used by us in order to
create KSP aswell as it contains links to those tools.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Playlist export is possible</span><br>
KSP allows user to export current playlist to KPL, PLS or M3U file<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Switched to Qt 4.5.3</span><br>
By default Windows installation contains Qt library version 4.5.3<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Playlist Quick Search</span><br>
Now it is possible to quickly search playlist for particular titles
artists or albums<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Play menu</span><br>
Play menu contains all audio controls and can be controlled with
keyboard<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R3</h2>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamic playlists</span><br>
To enable this feature right click on your playlist and then choose
VDJ-&gt;Enable. Ensure that this setting is checked and you are not in
offline mode (it requires internet connection). Now start playing some
track. KSP will automatically download from Last.fm data that will
allow it to establish if you have any other tracks similar to current
one. If you do then they will be added to the playlist.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Equalizer</span><br>
From now on you have an access to Equalizer (currently only KSP for
Windows compilations). Select setting you desire from Equalizer menu or
simply choose it yourself. To enable equalizer go to
Setup-&gt;KSP-&gt;System-&gt;Use Equalizer.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved database</span><br>
Recet changes allowed us to make multithreaded access to database more
stable. Also a few database support bugs have been eliminated.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">No MySQL support</span><br>
From now KSP supports only Sqlite databases.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lyrics</span><br>
If you are playing track that is in your Media Library you can link
your own lyrics to it. Just go to Currently Played tab and paste your
lyrics there. When you are done click Save Lyrics button. Next time you
play this track your lyrics will load automatically.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple selection (playlist)</span><br>
From now you can select multiple playlist entries for example in order
to delete them<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Offline mode</span><br>
If your network connection is poor or simply doesn't exist then you can
enable an offline mode. Note that if on your playlist you have some
network streams KSP still will be able to play them. Also internal web
browser will work although when you click on link to netowrk stream
playlist (such as those from icecast.org) KSP won't open it. Also
dynamic playlists won't work. Offline mode is not saved on exit which
means that next time you start KSP you still will have to enable it
manually again if you want to stay in offline mode.<br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R2.2</h2>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed "m3u" Playlist Buffer
Overflow</span><br>
It could happen that some playlists could not be properly handled and
that lead to application (and sometimes system) crash. It is rare
situation and considers only specially prepared playlists with long
strings in it. Now KSP by default processes only items with at most 260
characters in file name<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed MediaLibProgress bug
(always hidden)</span><br>
Due to problems with Linux version this progress bar was always hidden
even if rescanning media library. Now this progress bar is handled
different way which increases stability of Linux compilations<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">libbass.so is loaded from
/usr/share/KSP (Linux)</span><br>
Currently all non user specific data is loaded from /usr/share/KSP
excluding libqt4intf.so<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Agent string changed</span><br>
Currently builtin webbrwser uses following strings:<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KSP/&lt;version&gt;
(compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)</span> - Windows<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">KSP/&lt;version&gt; (X11; Linux
x86_64; U; pl, en_US) </span>- Linux<br>
where version is the version number of KSP (for example 0.2.200.150).<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving playlists as bookmarks
fixed (Linux)</span><br>
Playlists where saved in the wrong files. It was working well but still
now it looks more tidy and clean<br>
      <br>
      <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">KSP 2009 R2.1</h2>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Linux compilation possible (as
2009 R3 alpha)</span><br>
Since upcoming R3 release will have also Linux version we have ensured
that KSP even now works with Linux. Currently Linux port is still in
development but it generally works despite it's stability is lower than
Windows version. However current trunk allows Linux compilation.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Indy components instead of
WinInet unit</span><br>
Indy is replacing previously used WinInet based routines.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed getting meta from
Icecast/Shoutcast servers</span><br>
Now whenever meta data is received from server title of currently
played track is extracted, file name label is updated and notification
is shown according to notification settings.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed saving empty tags to KPL
playlists</span><br>
If playlist item has no tag then it can contain random data as tag.
That data is no longer saved to playlist.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Plugins loading changed (now
more info in logs)</span><br>
If for some reason plugins is found but cannot be loaded then
information with error code is available in logs.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Added option to store absolute
paths in playlists (by default disabled)</span><br>
Sometimes it happens (Linux compilations) that relative paths cannot be
generated so playlists are saved incorrectly. Now it is possible to use
absolute paths instead.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Added Tell A Friend menu item</span><br>
If you like KSP then you can easily let your friends know about KSP
with only a few clicks.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Added Report Bug menu item</span><br>
If you have found a bug or you want to request new feature then you can
easily do that with Bug report button.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Main web browser object has now
progress bar</span><br>
Main web browser has now the same progress bar as internet media
browser. It works the same way and looks the same way.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Media Library tweaks</span><br>
Several Media Library bugs have been fixed such as not removing non
existing or incorrect items from it.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Like" Media library search</span><br>
Go to Library and there you have new edit field. Put there part of the
file name you want to find in the Media Library and then press Find
Song Like button. Currently it supports finding songs only by file name.<br>
