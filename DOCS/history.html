properly (and load). KSP at the moment doesn't support checking if

is QT 4.5 (tested with 4.5.2)</span><br>
To obtain the newest QT version go to http://www.qtsoftware.com/.
Remember that KSP requires QT 4.5.x. All other QT versions ARE NOT
supported. Note than each build contains proper libraries so you don't
have to download over 300 mb archive from http://www.qtsoftware.com/.
All you require is installed with KSP. If you are building KSP from
source then you may want to download latest SVN build as well.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">WebKit is being used for Icecast
browsing, Icecast support (no XSPF playlists support yet)</span><br>

handle it and load replacing currently loaded playlist.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Simple notifications on playlist
end and playfile</span><br>
When new file is played or playlist end is reached simple notification
is displayed. At the moment it is in development so all configuration
can be made only by editing setup.opt file. Find section [Alerts] in
setup.opt file and put there:<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OnNewSongPlayed=1</span><br>

again. Note that scanning proces might take a while. In
Library-&gt;Setup there is also Setup Database button. KSP now supports
both Sqlite3 and MySQL databases. By default KSP uses Sqlite3 database

then use that button to configure connection to database server.<br>
